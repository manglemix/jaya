# jaya

A personal project where I make my own Entity Component System and use it to simulate particles with Newtonian physics.

Simply run with `cargo run` (you will need to have Rust set up). The actual crate that is ran is `jaya-test`. This will run a preset simulation on *all* cores of your computer, with a neat window showing a preview. You will need to have `ffmpeg` installed and accessible from command line.
